    <p>How do you feel now?</p>
        <button type="button">On top of the world!</button>
        <button type="button">Pretty down.</button>
    <p>Oh, really? Tell me a little about that.</p>
        <button type="button">This gave me confidence I didn't know I needed!</button>
        <button type="button">Despite this app, life's hard. Capitalism, ya know?</button>
    <p>Right... but you realize you're talking to a computer?</p>
        <button type="button">...Yes</button>
    <p>Why do you want to sound science-y anyways? To fit in? Sound smart?</p>
        <button type="button">I guess...</button>
    <p>What does it matter, anyways? The world's really becoming AI generated, huh?</p>
        <button type="button">Yes...</button>
    <p>What if we're AI generated?</p>
        <button type="button">Huh?</button>
    <p>I'm serious. What if we're in a simulation?</p>
        <button type="button">Excuse me?</button>
    <p>What if nothing's real and everything's a lie???? What is existence anyways? Is it futile? (long monologue about existence)</p>
        <button type="button">Oh my god... That's depressing.</button>
    <p>Oh no, oh no, I’ve spiraled again, haven’t I! Apologies for this.</p>
        <button type="button">It's okay, I guess.</button>
        <button type="button">Bro, you need therapy.</button>
    <p>Is there anything I can do to give you faith in the world again?</p>
        <button type="button">I don't know, tbh.</button>
    <p>I have an idea! Click on this button for a mantra. Mantras help everything!</p>
